The `ui` directory contains two sub-directories: `components` and `screens`.

## Screens
The screens directory is designed around the structure of the User Interface. Screens ~= pages and should closely match our Component nesting structure.

## Components
The components directory is designed for reusable components that are likely to appear in any of the application's screens. Things like Loading indicators, error pages, headers and footers. In a larger project, certain components might be extracted into a separate component library repository for use in multiple project.
